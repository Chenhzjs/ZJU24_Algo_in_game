# ZJU24_Algo_in_game
A clumsy imitation of the game Slay the Spire by using libgraphics provided by the ZJU C language programming course.

**The code can only run in the Windows environment.**

To run the code locally, you need to

```
git clone https://github.com/Chenhzjs/ZJU24_Algo_in_game.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```
*In fact, I forgot to delete the build files when I uploaded them, and I didn't add .gitignore either. :(*
